This project is a Netflix clone developed as part of my internship at Bharat Intern. 
It replicates the core features of Netflix, including user authentication, movie browsing, and streaming functionalities.
During my internship, I worked on building this project to demonstrate my skills in Html Css Js.
The project showcases my ability to develop a fully functional web application with a focus on frontend development
